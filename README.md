# Fake OS

This OS is a fun combo of the classic MacOS and iconic Windows98 -- named Banana!

Some inspiration for applications are taken from MacOS and Windows98; however, many of the available features of this fake OS are common beginner JavaScript projects that I undertook to practise my programming skills. The available features include:
- Connect 4
- Calculator
- Minesweeper
- Weather (in the taskbar)

Have fun while you're looking around!

## Connect 4

A popular boardgame made using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. Connect four of the same coloured tokens in a row to win!

## Calculator

A very basic yet functional calculator!

## Minesweeper

An all-time classic game found on Windows98. Try to find all the bombs!

## Weather (Taskbar)

**Note:** This feature does not function on the deployed version of this project.

Wondering what's the weather? Take a look at the right of the taskbar. Utilises the WeatherAPI.
